    /*Rules for Variable Naming in Java:
Start with a Letter or _ or $:

Variables must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z), an underscore _, or a dollar sign $.
Example: name, _value, $price.
No Spaces or Special Characters:

Spaces or symbols like @, #, ! are not allowed.
Correct: totalSum.
Incorrect: total sum.
Case-Sensitive:

variable and Variable are treated as different names.
Cannot Use Keywords:

Reserved words like int, class, public cannot be used as variable names.
Can Contain Digits (But Not at the Start):

Numbers can be included after the first character.
Correct: value1.
Incorrect: 1value.
Best Practices:
Use Camel Case:

Start with a lowercase letter and capitalize each subsequent word.
Example: studentName, totalPrice.
Be Descriptive:

Use meaningful names to improve readability.
Example: age instead of a.
Avoid Single-Letter Names (Except in Short Loops):

Use i, j, or k for loop counters only.
Start Constants with Uppercase:

Use final with uppercase and underscores for constants.
Example: final int MAX_LIMIT = 100;. */
